# Gypsy_Moths
This repository contains the code for data and animations of Gypsy Moth data from the Stop The Spread project. 

DRT was provided with a series of .csv files that contained the X coordinates, Y coordinates, and number of moths trapped for a given year. I don’t have those raw files uploaded here but can provide them upon request.

“GM data.py” is a script that combines all the files in that directory into a single file, “combined_csv.csv”.

“Gypsy Moth Static.py” creates an interactive map for the 2016 data. The year can be changed by modifying the script. "2016.html” is the output of Gypsy Moth Static.py”. 

Animations across years are in progress.
